### Java Software Engineer - *(January 2023 - March 2023, Prague)* 

I used to work as a freelancer for a telco company. I was involved in the analysis, design and development of microservices applications.

All applications were written in Java in Spring framework. To make the applications as efficient as possible, we used Project Reactor and WebFlux to write non-blocking code.

We used PostgresSQL as our database technology and Redis for caching or faster access to specific data.
We used the Hibernate ORM framework to work with the database and in some applications combined with JOOQ to compose dynamic queries.

### Java Software Engineer - *(September 2021 - December 2022, Prague)* 
I was part of the George Lab 1 team that worked on the backend of George Internet Banking. My work consisted of rewriting a legacy monolithic application into a microservice architecture.

I worked primarily with Java 8,11 and the Spring framework on the project. I was preparing new REST endpoints that integrated to other systems via Apache Kafka, REST API or SOAP.

### Tool Developer - *(August 2018 - September 2021, Prague)*  
I worked as a test tool developer. At first we developed additional tools over HP ALM (application lifecycle management) in PHP and Javascript (Vanilla, JQuery).

Later I was involved in the analysis and selection of a new, more modern testing tool. In the end, X-Ray (a JIRA plugin) was chosen, where I helped define the methodology.

I worked on migrating data from the old tool to the new one and then spent a long time developing JIRA plugins (Java, Spring framework, JIRA SDK) to make the application meet all the specific user requirements.

### Tester - *(July 2017 - August 2018, Prague)* 
During my studies I worked as a tester, where I did manual tests on Frontend or Backend manual tests via Postman.

Later I also got involved in developing automated tests in Robot Framework.
